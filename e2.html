        <p>EtAto FAQS.</p>
        <p>Roles Permissions: For all normal roles that every member can have the permissions are set to zero which means a member cannot send GIFS or Pictures. Now for some roles, this is exclusive. This includes OG VIP and Server Pro All of these roles have permission to send GIFS and Pictures(Embed files). Those roles can send any GIFS and Pictures(Embed files), in all channels. Now this isn't only about GIFS and Pictures there are also Staff roles. If you don't know what staff roles are they are the only roles that help the server owner which means: managing roles, time out, creating events, muting, banning Etc. Those roles are only given to hired members. Every server you have joined probably has bot roles(they are to separate them from members. Channels Permissions: Almost every channel you see is a text channel. There are also voice channels, meaning you don't type but speak with your voice. You are not allowed to send GIFS Pictures(Embed files) in almost every text channel only, if you have exclusive roles. You can send files only to media. In some channels, you are not allowed to speak on them those are announcements. Back to the voice channels. As I already said you speak with your voice you do need a microphone for it. Now you cannot speak during movie time(the channel is not always on) it is used to play a maximum of 1-2 hours long videos. Important: All important thing that all member should follow are: Be generous to every one, Swear is not allowed including mild swearing if it doesn't go towards other members, arguing with staff or other members is not welcome here. Also please do not speech agaisnt us or LGBTQ+ political.</p>
